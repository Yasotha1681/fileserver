A file server enables remote file sharing, storage, and access across a network, using protocols like FTP or HTTP. Vital for collaboration, backups, and distributed systems.


Introduction 
A server is a computer that is dedicated solely to the purpose of serving. It serves files to its clients whenever requests are made, and it should always be available. A program running on a port within the server is used to handle requests. The term ‘server’ can refer to a physical or virtual computer system (hardware), a program running inside the physical machine, or a virtual machine inside the physical machine. Servers can have databases or can be connected to other servers that have databases. A socket is an endpoint for communication between two computer machines over a network. A socket is a combination of a port number and an IP address, which is used to uniquely identify a specific process running on a specific computer. A process running on a server is communicating with a process running on a client computer and we have to identify both, the process as well as the computer so that we can request or send files to the right process of the right computer. Socket programming is used to establish communication between two processes that are running on different computers over a network. It is used to develop client-server applications. Socket programming can be implemented in various programming languages like Java, C++, Python, and so on. 
A file server in is a powerful application that facilitates the sharing and management of files across a network. It serves as a centralized repository for storing and retrieving files, allowing multiple clients to access, upload, download, and even modify files remotely. This server typically employs various protocols like FTP, HTTP, or custom protocols to handle file transfer requests efficiently. In this digital age, file servers play a crucial role in collaborative work environments, data backup solutions, and distributed systems.
